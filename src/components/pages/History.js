      <h5>Tracing Our Digital Footprints</h5>
      <p>Our origin is rooted in the passion of young Afghans eager to make a digital difference.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          In 2017, a spark was ignited during the "Youth in Internet Governance" workshop at
          the first National IGF Afghanistan (IGFA). That spark expanded, involving
          stakeholders from diverse arenas.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          By 2018, our commitment to the cause bore fruit with the establishment of
          pre-YouthIGFA, exclusively centering the discourse around youth and Internet
          Governance.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Finally, in 2019 we were able to organize the first full-fledged Youth Internet
          Governance Forum Afghanistan (YouthIGFA).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Every milestone is a testament to the spirit of Afghan youth, their dedication, and their
      undying belief in a better digital future.</p>
