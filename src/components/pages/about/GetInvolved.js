      Youth participation lies at the core of YouthIGFAâ€™s principles. We encourage both young
      people as well as established professionals to join us in ensuring an improved YouthIGFA
      each time. In addition to our annual YouthIGFA event, which offers a platform for active
      participation, we may offer periodic information sessions throughout the year. These
      opportunities allow youth to engage, exchange insights, and influence the future narrative of
      Internet governance in Afghanistan.
